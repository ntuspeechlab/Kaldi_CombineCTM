contains 2 fiels,  field1:field2
where 
field1   == __vu_ly_thy (hotword OP representation)
field2   == voo lee thy (pronunciation representation)

__vu_ly_thy#1: Vu Ly Thy
__vu_ly_thy#2: Voo Lee Thy
__vu_ly_thy#3: voo lee thy

Note that in above case we created 2 ways to pronunce the words
The first way is as it is spelt, the pronunciation from field 2!
and the disambiguation on the hotword is #1, and #2
its not important for capitalisation, so dont worry, just for replacement later on.
hence __vu_ly_thy#3 and __vu_ly_thy#2 produced exactly the same lexicon pronunication!
